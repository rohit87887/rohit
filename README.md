 Data Handling and Assumptions
Our system is designed to process real-world insurance data reliably by implementing robust preprocessing strategies:

 Handling Missing Values
Numerical Columns: Missing values are filled using the median to reduce the effect of outliers.

Categorical Columns: Missing entries are filled with the mode to maintain the most frequent value representation.

 Data Normalization
All text inputs (such as names, categories) are normalized by converting to lowercase and trimming whitespaces to ensure consistency and avoid mismatched labels.

 Encoding for Machine Learning
Label Encoding is applied to key categorical features such as:

State â€“ To represent geographical regions numerically.

Season â€“ For seasonal trend analysis.

Insurance_Type â€“ To make it suitable for model training and classification tasks.

 Real-World Input Handling
The prediction system is built to accept messy or imperfect user input and still produce accurate results. It includes:

Flexible parsing logic

Built-in preprocessing pipeline for incoming data

Graceful fallbacks for unexpected or noisy data
